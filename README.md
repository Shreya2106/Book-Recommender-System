# Book-Recommender-System
Collaborative Filtering Based Book Recommender System using KNN

The collaborative filtering approach mainly focuses on finding users who have given similar ratings to the same books,thus creating a connection 
between users to whom books will be suggested.In this way we look for associations between users and not between books.Therefore,collaborative 
filtering depends only on observed user behavior to make recommendations- no profile data or content data is necessary.Users who rate books in a 
similar manner share one or more hidden preferences.Users with shared preferences are likely to give ratings in the same way to the same books.
